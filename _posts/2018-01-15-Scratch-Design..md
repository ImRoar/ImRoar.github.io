**Year 7 Scratch Project Handbook**

By half term, you will have created your own game using Scratch. (don't worry, you can do it!)

It can be any sort of game you like. Your research should have given you a range of ideas and possibilities. 

Working through this handbook will take you to your solution!

**Step 1 **

Planning

* What is your game about?

* How will you win/lose or start/end the game?

* What needs to be in your game? 

**Step 2**

Designing

* What sprites will you need?

* What resources will you need? 

* What variables/broadcasts/custom blocks?

**Step 3**

Building

* This is the longest stage and will comprise several weeks and homeworks. 

**Step 4 **

Evaluating

* Have you achieved what you designed? 

* Test your game and the games of others.

**Step 5 **

Improving

* Once you receive feedback, what are you doing to do? 

* Make your game better. 

Step 1: Planning

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What is your game about? Name it. Describe the gameplay/how it is played. What is the purpose of the game?
Add a description below to tell me about your game. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My game is a very similar to the classic Mario game but a twist. Instead of looking from Mario's side we now look at Bowser’s view of things. The story is that One day Mario wanted to give Bowser a lethal power which Mario created, but then everything went wrong. Mario had reversed everything, smashing things when you were big were now breaking blocks with your head was only done when you were small.. He turned evil and then had the same thinking of Bowser. He then captured Princess Peach and Bowser comes to the rescue. The twist is that Bowser needs to fight all of his minions/koopalings again apart from the koopa troopa who is yoshi but has the ability to whizz through minions with ease and also has a great height jump but unfortunately not flutter fly. Since Bowser created them to help him capture Princess Peach now the koopalings and minions will help Mario to conquer the world and in the end Mario will turn enormous(the whole screen) and try to stop Bowser from hitting the forbidden button which will reverse everything. Then you also need to collect lots of starcoins in EVERY single level to get an extro world. The world will be given automatically but stages will not be unlocked unless you have collected all the star coins in every level. The "extra world" is basically a bonus world with bonus stages.</td>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>How will your game be won or lost? 
Make sure you add details here. Be precise.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>You will lose the game by losing all your lives and you will win by destroying Mario</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What elements need to be in your game? 
Describe/list what might need to be in your game: A fisherman that is trying to hook fish; the basket to land them in, etc. This part needs plenty of detail. Be thorough.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>There is Bowser who is going through various obstacles and gets powers (fire flower Mario, Penguin Mario and Flyer Mario). Bowser also needs to collect star coins to get a bonus world.  Then the minions have to stop Bowser from saving Princess Peach. Mario sends the koopalings to separate worlds to stop Bowser and in the end Mario will turn enormous(the whole screen) and try to stop Bowser from hitting the forbidden button which will reverse everything and turn Mario into good and Bowser turns into...well bowser!.</td>
  </tr>

**Project Checklist**

**Originality**

Is your project original or a remake of another project?

It is a runner game so the game is obviously quite similar to many games but there will be a different twist that will make it original.

**Creativity**

Is your project creative and is it different and unique?

It is a unique game in the sense that it is based in the mountains instead of elsewhere.

**Backgrounds**

Do the backgrounds/stage add to and enhance the product?

The background will show what the game is and add to the product. It will hopefully invite more people to play the game.

 

**Sprites**

Do the sprites/costumes you chose add to and enhance the product?

The monster sprites will make the game much harder and more exciting. The old wizard will explain what the game is about.

 

**Scripts**

Do the Scripts make the sprites effectively do what you want them to do? Do you have correct x y coordinates? Do you include "forevers" where needed, etc.

Yes the scripts will make sense. I will think twice before I code.

 

**Purpose**

Is the purpose of the product evident to the audience?

Yes, there will be notes at the beginning from a wizard. There will be a tutorial

 

**User-Friendly**

Is the product user friendly? Did you include notes to help the user know how to manipulate the product?

Yes, there will be notes at the beginning from a wizard.

Step 2: Designing

What Sprites will you need? Describe the Sprite and detail what it will do.
