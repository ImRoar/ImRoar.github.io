1)Super Mario Flash: 

The way the game was programed was that the arrow keys were to move so the left arrow was to go forward, the right arrow key was to go back and then to jump was the up arrow keys. When they were moving forward and back i realised that they didn't wait and then move it happened instantly.Also when you were moving in the homepage it gave you a little small mario or luigi character to choose the levels and then when you wanted to go stage 1 you werenâ€™t able to skip the stage as you needed to complete it to move on.Not to forget when you did choose the stage if showed you a small picture of the stage. In addition whenever you killed or "stomped" on a goomba it will give you a score of 100.

Space invaders: 

The game is very simple and again has an 8bit feeling to it.The controls are easy to understand and to use.Right arrow key moving to the right and left arrow key moving to the left and then the down arrow key shooting a little space beam to destroy the "SPACE INVADERS" or in other words aliens.It starts off with a simple opening page telling you the score of each alien or ufo and then you just need to start playing it. When you do start playing the game you will see the score in the top left and how much lives you have got in the top right decreasing every time you get shot at and also when you do get shot at you go back to the start (not resetting the whole game but just losing 1 out of 3 lives. There are also blocks to protect you but then when the aliens shoot them or even when you shoot them they slowly start disintegrating and to add a little challenge to the game the blocks won't spawn back in even when you complete a level.

**Tetris:**

Back to a more classic game, tetris is highly addictive because of it's simplicity and that every time you match up a line it disappears.Also it gives a lot of information by giving you the score,the level,how many lines you have completed,the next block and the block which you can save for later incase of emergencies.You are also able to rotate the blocks and in coding (when you are on scratch) it will say turn 90 degrees or another option.

**Sonic the hedgehog:**

One of the most classic games you will ever find sonic the hedgehog.The game is very simple but at times can get the worst out of people.First of all the game which i played on has got an opening menu with **Play,Options,Passwords? And cheats,**and if you are wondering the cheats is a troll there are none.This was the opening page and when you start the game it tell you which act with an over dramatic scene and with a cool spiky block with some spikes at the end and embedded inside it is **ACT 1**.The part which i feel most effective is that when you collect coins and bump into an enemy he does a small jump and falling back 

animations and some sweats dripping out of head and coins falling out of his pockets.The animals which you are mostly likely to be killed are by a sinister looking monkey on a tree and a lot more depressing looking crab, which bizarrely shoots out of his pincers, fireballs?  ![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/VNQ2oUb6GKTAAVS15OKg_img_0.png)
